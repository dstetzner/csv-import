# csv-import
An Application that Imports a CSV File to SQL Database

The goal is to have this application import CSV files, parse the data, and import it into a SQL Database. 

Once the data is the in the database we will use identifiers to export the parsed data into a specfic text output file that we can use as a macro-base for the ERP I work in.
